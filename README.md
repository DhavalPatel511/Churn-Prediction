# Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview:

The Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunication company. The project involves various stages such as data reading, data exploration, data visualization, data cleaning, and feature engineering using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. After preprocessing the data, different machine learning algorithms including AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated. Confusion matrices were drawn for each algorithm, and the performance of models was compared using AUC-ROC curves.

## Key Components:

1. **Data Reading and Exploration:**
   - Utilized Pandas library to read the dataset from a CSV file and perform initial exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability for modeling.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engineered new features and transformed existing ones to improve the predictive power of the models.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Trained machine learning models including AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest using the preprocessed data to predict customer churn.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the performance of each model using confusion matrices to analyze the classification results.
   - Compared the performance of models using AUC-ROC curves to assess their predictive accuracy and discrimination ability.

## Code and Usage:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhavalPatel511/Churn-Prediction.git
   cd Telecom-Churn-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Explore the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to understand the workflow and execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Results:

The project provides insights into customer churn prediction for the telecommunication company, facilitating proactive measures to retain customers and improve business performance. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and comprehensive evaluation techniques, the project aids in understanding customer behavior and optimizing retention strategies.
